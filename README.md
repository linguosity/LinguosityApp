 Here is an expanded timeline with more details, structured to highlight the most relevant details from each section:

Initial Prototype and Testing Setup

The most relevant details I found here were:

- Brandon began working on an initial prototype of Linguosity on May 21st and reached out to his advisor Johannes for help with setting up testing and deployment workflows
- On May 22nd, Brandon and Johannes had a call to troubleshoot build errors related to NPM packages and connectivity issues due to Brandon's work network blocking access
- After fixing Git merge conflicts related to concurrent branches, Brandon got a basic conversational flow working by May 27th for generating stories via ChatGPT prompts

Core App Functionality  

The most relevant details I found here were: 

- On May 31st, Brandon started experimenting with integrating the Bark text-to-speech API but found latency issues, with it taking 5+ minutes to generate audio for even small amounts of text
- This led to exploring the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API on June 4th as a potential alternative synthesis solution
- By June 5th, Brandon was able to successfully implement text-to-speech using the ElevenLabs API, which provided better speed and more natural voices

Optimization and Enhancements

The most relevant details I found here were:

- On June 6th, Brandon did performance testing of story generation through the GPT-3 API, identifying latency issues with prompt processing taking over 40 seconds
- To improve user experience for the slow story generation, Brandon researched adding a progress bar feature on June 7th
- Follow-up discussions occurred June 10-12th with advisor Johannes on planning additional enhancements and debugging pain points

Refactoring and Redesign

The most relevant details I found here were:

- On August 27th, Brandon hired freelance developer Enrique to implement new features, including Google authentication and a customizable input form
- By August 28th, Enrique delivered working prototypes for Firebase-powered Google login and a form overlay for capturing story generation parameters  

- On August 29th, Enrique introduced the Grommet UI framework to facilitate responsive design in preparation for removing custom CSS
- Testing and merging of branches occurred to integrate Enrique's new features into the main codebase

Additional Tasks 

The most relevant details I found here were:

- On August 31st, Enrique provided timeline estimates and pricing to extend PlayHT's text capacity for text-to-speech narration, save generated speech as MP3 files, and bundle content into PDF documents
- By September 1st, Enrique delivered the MP3 export capability to chunk long input text and save narrated audio
