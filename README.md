 `Pre-reading` . 

PROMPT 2
 Expand the key details and main ideas from 
 `Output 1`  into a complete story written in  
 `Target Language` in the style of 
 `Genre, discourse or text` with a passage length of  
 `Passage length` including its appropriate title under the heading STORY PASSAGE. This story must follow the following narrative structure: 1. Begin with compelling action to draw the reader in.
2. Provide background information to introduce the characters and their circumstances.
3. Develop the characters by revealing their values and motivations.
4. Construct the plot with drama, actions, and tension stemming from the characters' motivations.
5. Build up to the climax, where the main characters experience a significant change.
6. Conclude the story by highlighting the characters' transformed state, what they are left with, and the meaning of the events.


Additionally, incorporate Perlin noise to introduce smooth variations in vocabulary choices, sentence structures, or word order. This will create a natural variability in the text, providing a unique linguistic texture to the story.

 `Target Language` include the following post-reading activities:
